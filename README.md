Partial 6502 simulator heavily inspired by Nick Morgan's 
[Easy6502](http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) tutorial.

No dependencies are required other than JRuby.

To play a game of Snake6502, run:

    $ ruby bin/vintage examples/snake.rom

To disassemble the bytecode for the game, run:

    $ ruby bin/vintage-debug examples/snake.rom

All credit goes to Nick Morgan for the Snake6502 program. I didn't write it!
But if you have any questions about the Vintage simulator, please
